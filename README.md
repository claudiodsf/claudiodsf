# Hi there 👋

My name is Claudio Satriano, I'm a [seismologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology) at the [Institut de physique du globe de Paris](https://www.ipgp.fr).

Here you can find several software packages that I developed, mainly for seismology.

If you want to find out more, please check [my webpage 🌍](https://www.ipgp.fr/~satriano).
